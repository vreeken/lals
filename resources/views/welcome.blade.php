                    The Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum (LALSRM) was founded in 1956. It was started by train enthusiasts for the purpose of educating people in railroad history and lore and also to further the avocation of live steam, gas-mechanical and electronic railroad technology.

                    We operate our 7½” gauge model trains for the general public to ride from 11 am – 3 pm every Sunday (weather permitting). We also have extensive layouts for 4¾”, 3½”, G, and #1 gauge model trains.

                    The Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum survives solely on donations by railfans who visit and ride our trains (suggested donation $3.00). In keeping with our philosophy of giving back to our community, we also host special events for Children’s Hospital, The City of Hope, Make-A-Wish Foundation, Tri Valley Special Games and other organizations.
